# Absorb

A modern audiobookshelf client with a card-based player experience.

> **A note on AI:** Absorb is developed by a human with AI assistance (mostly Claude Code) helping write, refactor, and review code. It's not "vibe coded" or auto-generated, every change is reviewed, tested, and shipped intentionally. That said, I'm all in on AI as a development tool. It massively speeds up the work and lets a solo developer ship features and fixes at a pace that wouldn't be possible otherwise. I'm sharing this openly so you know what's behind the app.

### Release Tracks

**GitHub Pre-Releases (Alpha)** - Frequent updates with new features and bug fixes. In Obtainium you can toggle pre-releases on or off.

**GitHub Full Releases (Beta/Stable)** - Once a pre-release is solid, it gets promoted to a full release. These match what's pushed to Google Play and the App Store.

### Google Play

Open testing is live - [join the open beta on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.barnabas.absorb). Open testing and production releases match GitHub full releases. Internal testing (alpha) matches GitHub pre-releases - join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/dW4Y4zCxRp) to request access to the internal track.

### App Store

Live on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/absorb-for-audiobookshelf/id6760673498). App Store releases match GitHub full releases. Some features are still Android-only or in progress, see iOS section below.

### iOS TestFlight (Alpha)

TestFlight is the iOS alpha track, matching GitHub pre-releases. Builds are more frequent and less polished than the App Store version. [Join the TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/GgUbDbve). If you want stable builds, use the App Store instead.

### iOS Alpha (Sideload)

Alpha `.ipa` files are included in GitHub pre-releases alongside the Android APK. If you know how to sideload IPAs (via AltStore, Sideloadly, etc.), you can grab the latest alpha build from the [releases page](../../releases). For most users, TestFlight is easier - automatic updates and no sideloading setup.

## Android Auto

Absorb supports Android Auto for browsing and listening from your car. If you are using the github version, you'll need to enable unknown sources in Android Auto:

> 1. Open **Android Auto** settings on your phone
> 2. Tap **Version** at the bottom repeatedly to enable Developer mode
> 3. Tap the three-dot menu (top right) and select **Developer settings**
> 4. Enable **Unknown sources**
>
> This is required because Absorb from Github is not distributed through Google Play's production track.

## Requirements

- An [audiobookshelf](https://www.audiobookshelf.org/) server (self-hosted)
- Android 7.0+ / iOS 16+
