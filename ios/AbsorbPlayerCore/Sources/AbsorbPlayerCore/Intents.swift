// engine, so every shared flag used to be written by both sides and a single
// widget tap could actuate playback in both processes - two overlapping
// streams of the same book.
//
// The arbitration is now pid-based: `audio_owner_pid` names the one process
// allowed to act on widget taps, and each process's Flutter proves it is
// alive via its own pid-scoped `flutter_alive_at_<pid>` heartbeat, so no
// process can vouch for (or impersonate) another.

// MARK: - App Intents
//
// AudioPlaybackIntent (iOS 17+) tells the system this intent controls
// audio playback. Combined with @Dependency on AbsorbPlayerCoreProtocol,
// iOS launches the host app's process (where the dependency is
// registered in AppDelegate) to run perform() rather than running it in
// the widget extension's sandbox where AbsorbPlayerCore isn't reachable.
//
// The intents live in this shared package (rather than the widget
// extension target) so both Runner and NowPlayingWidgetExtension see the
// same Swift type. AppDependencyManager.shared.add() in the host app is
// keyed by Swift type identity, and types declared only in the widget
// extension target wouldn't match anything the host app registered.
//
// Each intent is marked iOS 16+ since AppIntents itself is iOS 16+.
// Runner deploys back to iOS 15; the widget extension is iOS 17. Runner
// guards its use of these symbols with `if #available(iOS 16, *)`.
